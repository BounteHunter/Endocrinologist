 A machine learning model which predicts whether or not the user has diabetes is developed using sklearn.
 -----------------------------
 1.SVM has been used for model.
 2.To make user friendly, stripped off a GUI and built a website which has form to accept input from user.
 3.Model was Written in python.
 4.Results were sent from Website to Firestore (Cloud provision of Firebase).
 5.Temporary Results were sent through angular to Flask.
 6.Flask routes the data to the model and returns the result of the model prediction.
 7.Prediction is sent to cloud and also rendered a new route displaying the results.
 
 Previous Versions of this project were not maintained.
